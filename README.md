# My Portfolio Site
Personal portfolio and resume website.

## Description

This portfolio is templated from Tim Baker's React-based personal resume website template. Built with typescript on the Next.js framework, styled with Tailwind css, and populated with data from a single file.  Even better, the site is fully mobile-optimized and server-side rendered to ensure fast loading and a clean UI on any device.

## Run Locally

### 1. Make sure you have what you need

To build this website, you will need to have the latest stable versions of Node and Yarn downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have them, you can get Node [here,](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Yarn [here.](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### 2. Install dependencies and run

Once you have your own copy of this repo forked and downloaded, open the folder in your favorite terminal and run `yarn install` to install dependencies. Following this, run `yarn dev` to run the project. In your terminal you should be given the url of the running instance (usually http://localhost:3000 unless you have something else running).

### 3. Customize the data to make it your own

All of the data for the site is driven via a file at `/src/data/data.tsx`. This is where you'll find the existing content, and updating the values here will be reflected on the site. If you have the site running as described above, you should see these changes reflected on save. The data types for all of these items are given in the same folder in the `dataDef.ts` file. Example images can be found at `src/images/` and are imported in the data file. To change, simply update these images using the same name and location, or add new images and update the imports. 

### 4. Hook up contact form
Due to the variety of options available for contact form providers, I've hooked up the contact form only so far as handling inputs and state. Form submission and the actual sending of the email is open to your own implementation. My personal recommendation for email provider is [Sendgrid.](https://sendgrid.com/)

### 5. Deploy to Vercel and enjoy your new Resume Website

Deploying your new site to Vercel is simple, and can be done by following their guide [here.](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel) When you're all done and the build succeeds, you should be given a url for your live site, go there and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
